## Projects

### [`rosscope`](https://github.com/sidhantjha/rosscope) — AI-Powered ROS 2 Debugging Environment *(Startup)*
> Developer Tooling · LLM-integrated · Live Graph Visualization

ROS 2 development is brutal — cryptic TF errors, silent node failures, transform drift that takes hours to diagnose. **rosscope** is an intelligent debugging environment that wraps your ROS 2 session with live node graph visualization, semantic error diagnosis, and AI-assisted troubleshooting. Built for robotics engineers who want to spend time on the actual problem, not the middleware.

### [`hydra_tb4_autonomy`](https://github.com/sidhantjha/hydra_tb4_autonomy) — ROS 2 + Hydra 3D Scene Graph Stack
> 3D Scene Graphs · TSDF Reconstruction · LLM-based Semantic Planning · Nav2

Deployed MIT SPARK Lab's Hydra Dynamic Scene Graph pipeline on ROS 2 Jazzy as the world representation layer in a joint NSF CPS perception-planning-control architecture (UIUC × MIT). Engineered a full sensor integration pipeline bridging TurtleBot3 Gazebo to Hydra's uHumans2 format — remapping 8 sensor topics, resolving TF inconsistencies across 5+ coordinate frames, modifying the TurtleBot3 Waffle SDF model to add 32FC1 depth sensing, and extending TSDF max_range from 5m to 10m for 60% improved depth coverage. Traced and resolved a silent Gazebo sensor bridge misconfiguration causing TSDF integration failure despite all pipeline components appearing active.

### [`AVIATE-SharedAutonomy`](https://github.com/sidhantjha/aviate-shared-autonomy) — Human–AI Cooperative Control
> Game Theory · Nash Equilibrium Switching · Stochastic Override Models

Investigating shared autonomy between human and AI agents for general dynamical systems using game-theoretic formulations. Implementing cooperative takeover policies from identical-interest dynamic games and Nash equilibrium switching strategies. Analyzing cost-sensitive authority transitions via linear–quadratic saddle-point recursions under stochastic human override models (pₖ). Benchmarking against ad-hoc baselines in OpenAI Gymnasium under disturbance and partial observability. Extending the Flip_Alt framework beyond self-driving to UAV and multi-robot domains.

### [`SkySync`](https://github.com/sidhantjha/skysync) — Decentralized Multi-UAV Formation Control
> APF · Consensus ADMM · MPC · Peer-Reviewed · Anduril AI Grand Prix

Designed and validated a hybrid control architecture combining Artificial Potential Fields, Consensus ADMM, and Model Predictive Control for simultaneous UAV swarm formation maintenance and obstacle avoidance. **Published and presented** at the AIAA Region III Student Conference, University of Michigan. Validated across 80 simulation trials: 80% mission success rate, 70.4% collision reduction vs. standalone APF, zero obstacle penetrations across all 20 hybrid trials. Hardware deployment on Crazyflie 2.1+. **Currently competing in the Anduril AI Grand Prix Drone Swarm Competition.**

### [`AutoDock`](https://github.com/sidhantjha/autodock) — Autonomous Racing @ ICRA 2026
> F1TENTH · SLAM · MPCC · Pure Pursuit · Rob Racer Sim Racing League

**Competing in the Rob Racer Sim Racing League at ICRA 2026** (F1TENTH platform). Building and benchmarking a full algorithm stack: minimum-curvature racing line optimization, Pure Pursuit tracking, Model Predictive Contouring Control (MPCC), Model and Acceleration-based Pursuit (MAP) with Pacejka tire dynamics, and minimum-time trajectory optimization via CasADi + IPOPT. Unknown-track pipeline: SLAM (slam_toolbox) → racing line extraction → particle filter localization → Pure Pursuit, with Follow-the-Gap and Disparity Extender as reactive fallbacks. Hybrid mode-switching state machine for qualification and time-attack rounds.

### [`AirframeX`](https://github.com/sidhantjha/airframex) — Low-Level Quadrotor Flight Control
> PID · Reinforcement Learning · Euler–Lagrange Dynamics · PX4

Implementing and tuning PID controllers on Pixhawk-based quadrotors for roll, pitch, and thrust stabilization. Engineering RL state-machine policies to optimize motor thrust under nonlinear flight dynamics. Modeling propeller-arm torque–thrust coupling via Euler–Lagrange formulation. Configured PX4 flight control systems including motor mapping, ESC calibration, PWM/OneShot/DShot protocols, and RC input via QGroundControl and MAVLink.

### [`Multi-Robot-Explore`](https://github.com/sidhantjha/multi-robot-explore) — Autonomous Decentralized Exploration
> Partial Observability · Distributed Control · Stochastic Noise

Decentralized ROS 2 autonomy architecture with per-agent controllers under partial observability and bounded communication delays. Robustness evaluated via task success rate and formation RMSE under dynamic disturbances.
